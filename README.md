# Lumin Engine

## Overview

This is a work-in-progress game engine. What is already complete however, are an entity component system (ECS) and
a working 2D impulse-based rigid body physics engine. The project is set up with a demonstration example showcasing
the physics engine.

## Disclaimer

The reason why the project is work-in-progress is that the rendering engine built on WebGPU is incomplete. Currently,
this rendering engine has been disconnected from the main game engine, and a dummy engine using Canvas2D has been
attached.
