# Lumin Engine

## Overview

This a 2D impulse-based rigid body physics engine attached to an entity component system (ECS). The code initializing the example scene can be found in `ExampleScene.ts`. This project is slightly work-in-progress because the integration of the rendering system with the broader ECS is not complete, but the physics engine itself is functional.
