# Lumin Engine

## Overview

This a 2D impulse-based rigid body physics engine attached to an entity component system (ECS). The project is set up with a demonstration example showcasing the physics engine.

This project is technically work-in-progress, as the final goal is to be a web-based 2D game engine, but you are free to refer to the code for the physics engine implementation as that is actually complete.

## Disclaimer

The reason why the project is work-in-progress is that the rendering engine built on WebGPU is incomplete. Currently, this rendering engine has been disconnected from the main game engine, and a dummy engine using Canvas2D has been attached.
